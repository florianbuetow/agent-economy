{"id":"agent-economy-xkb","title":"Extract database abstractions from business logic in Identity, Task Board, and Court","description":"Three of four services (Identity, Task Board, Court) hardcode sqlite3.connect() directly inside business logic classes (AgentRegistry, TaskManager, DisputeService). This violates DIP — business logic is coupled to a specific storage implementation, blocking unit testing without real databases and preventing future migration to PostgreSQL or other backends. For each service: (1) Define a repository protocol/interface in the service layer that describes the persistence operations needed. (2) Move SQLite-specific code into a concrete repository implementation. (3) Inject the repository via constructor in the business logic class. (4) The lifespan (composition root) creates the concrete SQLite repository and injects it. The Reputation service already demonstrates this pattern well with FeedbackStore — use it as the reference. Additionally, for Identity, the AgentRegistry also mixes cryptographic validation and JWS handling with persistence — consider extracting CryptoVerifier and JWSVerifier alongside the AgentRepository.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"2320560+florianbuetow@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-03-01T03:41:36Z","created_by":"Florian","updated_at":"2026-03-01T03:41:36Z"}
